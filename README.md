# React Native: Uninitialized State Variable Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: attempting to access a state variable before it has been properly initialized.  This often results in errors like 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')'.  The example focuses on functional components and the useState hook.

## The Problem

Uninitialized state variables lead to runtime errors when you try to use them in calculations or access their properties before the component has had a chance to set an initial value.

## The Solution

Always provide an initial value when declaring a state variable using `useState`. If dealing with asynchronous data fetching, implement loading states and error handling to gracefully handle situations where data might not be available immediately.  Conditional rendering can also prevent errors by only displaying dependent elements after the state is initialized.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to run the app on an emulator or device.
