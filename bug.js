This error occurs when you are using a state variable in a component that is not properly initialized. The state might be undefined or null initially, leading to errors when trying to access its properties or use it in calculations.  This often happens when using functional components with useState hook, and forgetting to provide the initial state or using it before the component has mounted.  For example, if you have a state variable 'count' and try to use `count + 1` before `count` is initialized, the error will occur.  A similar issue might happen when dealing with asynchronous data fetching, where the state variable is updated only after the data has been fetched, causing error before the update completes.

Example of buggy code:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(); //Missing initial state 

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count + 1}</Text> {/* Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '+') */}
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
